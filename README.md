# Web Scrap some English Test Preparation Book's Free Resources

That's truly a name.

## Installation

Just run:

```sh
npm i
```

## Configuration

It's important to define a variable in a `.env` file with the webpage URL.

```sh
WEB_PAGE=...
```

## Run

As simple as:

```sh
npm run start
```

## Notice

* This code was made for personal use to easily download resources for an English test preparation book I bought last year.
* I did this as practice for web scraping, as well as to have fun while getting content to prepare for my tests.
* I tried as much as possible to hide any information related to the page where I found this.

It's important to clarify that this book's complementary media
content (such as audio tracks) is provided completely FREE on their
official website. For that reason, I proceeded with this script
anyway, since the only purpose of the page is to download those
media files.

If requested, I'm open to closing this repo.
